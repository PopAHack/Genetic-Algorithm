Welcome to our coooode

This program uses GA

Currently randomly creates 256 stacks of boxes from list of boxes provided,
picks 50% of the best ones and creates another 128 from them

They have a 100% chance of mutating, We set this because it seemed to give us the best consistances between runs

You can change the Mutation part in the Stack Class under mutate

As well as the number of stacks being created and used in the NPStack class under the initPop method

Otherwise Enjoy!!! :D
